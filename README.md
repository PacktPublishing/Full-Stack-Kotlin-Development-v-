## About the Video Course
Kotlin brings many advantages to Java developers. Spring framework has taken Kotlin as one of their supported languages, and that makes Kotlin a perfect pairing with Spring for web application development. A strongly typed language like Kotlin brings safety to Javascript development. Creating a React application with Kotlin gives developers superior IDE support and type safety of a statically typed language.
This course will take you through the development of a full-stack application with Kotlin. First, we’ll create a back-end Spring MVC application with Kotlin. We’ll show you a generic Spring framework structure, how it maps to Kotlin, and how to enhance our application with Spring’s brilliant data access, security, and web service support. 
Later, the course walks you through React application development with Kotlin. We’ll touch on the overall React application structure, data flow, and communication with the server over XHR. In the third volume, we’ll look at both back-end and front-end architecture and give you some ideas on how to make a seamless full-stack application with enhanced server-side rendering, data sharing between layers and reactive programming around Spring framework’s new reactive capabilities.
